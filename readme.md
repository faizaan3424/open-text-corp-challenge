# Open Text Corporation Application Challenges

Here are my answers in Python to the two challenges posed on the **Full Stack Digital Developer Intern** application.

- Challenge 1: Completed BONUS function using Turtle Graphics. Run `challenge_1.py` with any two integer input for m and n, and ensure `turtle` is installed (run `pip install turtle` if not).
- Challenge 2: Run `challenge_2.py` with `beautifulSoup4` installed for web scraping.
